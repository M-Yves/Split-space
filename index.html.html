                <h1>About Us</h1>
                <p>Welcome to Split Space, <br>
                where we believe that sharing the cost of housing should be simple, transparent, and <br>
                beneficial for everyone involved. Our mission is to create a platform that brings <br>
                individuals together to collaboratively share the expenses of comfortable living br
                spaces, fostering a sense of community and financial ease</p>
                <h1>Our Vision</h1>
                <p>At Split Space, we envision a future where the burden of housing costs is <br> 
                    lightened through shared responsibility. We aim to create a network of like- <br>
                    minded individuals who recognize the value of cooperative living and the positive <br> 
                    impact it can have on both their wallets and overall well-being.</p>
